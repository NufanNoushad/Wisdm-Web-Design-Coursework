            My name is Nufan and my role is Student 2, I designed and developed
            the home page, global template & CSS, table page.
          </h2>
          <h3 id="home-introduction">
            Purpose: The home page is the main entry point where users will land
            when the enter the website. It serves as the main hub and it allows
            you to navigate to other pages of the website.
          </h3>
          <p class="home-page-explanation">
            The Quality Education's home page uses a structured combination of
            HTML and CSS to create a visually appealing, functional and a
            responsive page. Below I have explained the key HTML elements and
            CSS used to build this page, and also explaining their logic and
            purpose.
          </p>

          <h3>Home Page's HTML / CSS Structure and Key Features</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The DOCTYPE HTML tag makes sure that the document is written in
              HTML5
            </li>
            <li>
              The html lang en tag ensured that the document is written in
              English for accessibility.
            </li>
            <li>
              The header section includes the website logo for branding, which
              is clickable and returns users to the home page.
            </li>
            <li>
              I used the height technique using CSS in order to style the logo
              size consistently across each page
            </li>
            <li>
              For the navigation bar, I utilised CSS hover effects so that when
              the user hovers it highlights active links
            </li>
            <li>
              I implemented flexbox for better alignment and used
              <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp"
                >W3Schools Flexbox Syntax</a
              >
            </li>
            <li>
              For the mission statement section, I made use of h2 and p tags in
              order to communicate the website's goal<br />
              and purpose and applied the CSS technique of justify content for
              spacing and readability.
            </li>
            <li>
              Footer section: Includes a direction link to this Page Editor,
              uses a fixed position (CSS) to stay visible even when scrolling up
              and down.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="home-page-accessibility">Home Page's Accessibility</h3>
          <p>
            To ensure the home page was accessible, I made sure to follow accessibility principles such as<br>
            semantic HTML. I used appropriate alt text to all images, ensuring that users with visual<br>
            impairment would be able to understand the content. Also, I implemented hover effects on<br>
            navigation bar to enhance the user experience and accessibility.

            Challenges & Lessons Learned
          </h3>
          <p>
            <h4>Ensuring responsiveness</h4>
            One of the biggest challenges I faced when building the home page
            was making sure it was displayed<br />
            properly and responsive, to make sure that elements like the navigation bar, images, and footer adapted<br>
            well to different screen sizes took me some extra effort.
          </p>
          <h4>Lesson learnt</h4>
          <p>I learnt the important of responsive design techniques, such as media queries in CSS, and testing the<br>
          design on different devices using Inspect Element</p>
          <h4>CSS Styling Consistency</h4>
          <p>Ensuring that the CSS was consistency across all pages was difficult, especially with buttons,<br>
          links, and the navigation bar.</p>
          <h4>Lesson learnt</h4>
          <p>Using a global CSS stylesheet made it easy for everyone to know what global style, fonts and colours to utilise</p>

          <h3 class="home-page-compliance">Compliance</h3>
          <p>
            The home page complies with the Janet regulations by following accessibility. I made sure the page met<br>
            the accessibility guidelines by utiling a navigation bar and hover effects. This approach made sure that the home<br>
            page was accessible for all users.

          <h3>Table Page's HTML / CSS Structure and Key Features</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Utilised table, tr, th, td tag to ensure the data was clearly presented in a tabular format for comparison between different programs.
            </li>
            <li>
              Used h ref anchor links to direct users to more detailed information about each program on the Content page.
            </li>
            <li>
              Utilised t head and t body elements to seperate the header and body of the table for better organisation.
              <br>It also helped with grouping content and improving accessibility by distinguishing between table headings and information.
            </li>
            <li>
              Tootltips span and title attribute for giving users more information when hovering over cells, which improved the user experience by giving extra details without cluttering the table.

            </ul>

          <h3 class="table-page-accessibility">Table Page's Accessibility</h3>
          <p>
            The table page is designed with accessibility in mind to make sure that all users, including those with disabilities, can access and navigate the content effectively.. The table layout is structured using HTML elements like table, thead, and tbody. The use of tooltips through the title attribute allows for more information to be provided without overwhelming the pag econtent.

            Challenges & Lessons Learned
          </h3>
          <p>While working on the Table Page, one of the key challenges was ensuring the data was presented in a way that was both visually appealing and easy to navigate. Also utilising colspan and rowspan was something I didn't truly understand until I referred back to the lecture notes</p>
 

          <h3 class="table-page-compliance">Compliance</h3>
          <p>
            The table page adhers to the Janet regulations, making sure that they meet the required standards for accessibility, and usability. In order to comply with these guidelines I implemented accessibility features such as alt text for images, keyboard navigability, and semantic HTML Furthermore, the pages adhere to best practices in responsive design, ensuring they are accessible across all devices, which is a key aspect of Janet's recommendations for modern web development. I also ensured that the content is free from any copyrighted or restricted material, in line with Janet's regulations for content compliance. By incorporating these principles, I have created a table page that is both compliant with Janet regulations and optimised for a safe and accessible web experience.

          <h3 id="content-introduction">
            Purpose: The Wisdm Content Page presents an overview of Wisdm's educational activities, with a focus on significant projects that promote quality education.  It describes various major programs, including digital literacy for adults in developing countries, STEM education for women, teacher training initiatives, and inclusive education for pupils with special needs.  The page is intended to educate visitors about these programs and illustrate their impact in various areas.  In addition, the page has an intuitive structure with graphics, internal links for easy navigation, and a sidebar to help readers rapidly access key areas.  This structure provides an entertaining and instructive user experience while also supporting Wisdm's education program.

          <p class="content-page-explanation">
          </p>

          <h3>Content Page's HTML / CSS Structure and Key Features</h3>
          <p>The content page is structured in a straightforward, accessible manner, with semantic HTML elements such as header, nav, main, and footer ensuring a logical flow for both people and search engines.  The usage of section elements organises the content into separate categories, such as "Introduction," "Digital Literacy," and "Teacher Training Initiative," making it easier to navigate.  Anchor items in the navigation menu link to various portions of the page, enhancing the user experience by providing direct access to crucial material.  Headings, such as h1, h2, h3, and h5, provide a clear hierarchy, allowing visitors to easily comprehend the structure of the material.
          </p>
          <p>CSS like flexbox are used to build a responsive and visually appealing layout, ensuring that the page adapts to different screen sizes.  Font family, colour, and margin are examples of styling properties that are used to improve readability and make text visually appealing.  Images are labelled with alt text for accessibility, ensuring that visually challenged people can access the information communicated by images.  The sidebar with internal links lets visitors to swiftly navigate between parts, improving navigation without disrupting the page's general flow.  Overall, these strategies help to create an organised, user-friendly, and accessible information page.</p>

            The table page is designed with accessibility in mind to make sure that all users, including those with disabilities, can access and navigate the content effectively..

            Challenges & Lessons Learned
          </h3>
          <p>One of the most difficult aspects of implementing the content page was ensuring that the layout was clean and user-friendly, especially with the sidebar for internal navigation.  Initially, the sidebar overlapped with the main content on certain screen sizes, resulting in a cluttered appearance.  To address this, I utilised CSS flexbox to build a more flexible and organised structure, ensuring that the sidebar and content section were properly spaced across all screen widths.  Additionally, aligning graphics within text and ensuring they did not disrupt the flow of the information was difficult at first.  This was addressed utilising CSS features such as 'float', 'clear', and'margin' to ensure proper placement and spacing.

            Another problem was keeping the design similar across multiple browsers.
           </p>
           <p>These problems taught me the value of testing and changing the layout at various phases of development.  I also learnt more about CSS for complicated layouts, as well as how tiny stylistic changes may significantly improve the overall user experience.  This experience taught me to always prioritise visual flow and text clarity, ensuring that the design adapts effectively to different screen sizes and is functional across several browsers.</p>
    

          <h3 class="content-page-compliance">Compliance</h3>
          <p>
            The content page's compliance with online standards and laws was a top priority.  The page was developed with accessibility in mind, adhering to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.  All photos have alternative text (alt text), allowing people with visual impairments to interpret the material.  The usage of semantic HTML tags like headers, paragraphs, and sections guarantees that the material is user-friendly and search engine optimised.

 In terms of Janet regulations governing web page publication, the page complies with standards by utilising correct, well-structured HTML and CSS to improve reading and navigation.  The page design is responsive, which means that the content appears nicely on multiple devices and screen sizes.
